# C++ Project

~~C++ Learning~~ (done with that) -> **OpenGL Learning** -> Video Game

## The important bits
### Folders
- *Cheat Sheets*: A bunch of sample code and lessons from w3s
- *include*: OpenGL Libraries
- *lib*: GLFW Library
- *src*: the actual source code, as well as the glad.c file (OpenGL Loader).
### Specific Files
- *glfw3.dll*: GLFW System Binary (this would not work on a mac)
### Where did i get the files from?
- https://glad.dav1d.de/ (GLAD)
- https://www.glfw.org/download.html (GLFW) (To compile this on a mac, download the MacOS binaries, and replace the system binary "glfw3.dll" with the corresponding file)
### Compiler
- Follow the steps at this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp and follow the MinGW section
